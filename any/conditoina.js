/* 
CONDITIONALS
1. meaning of: >, <, >=, <=, ==, |=, ===, |==,
Ans:> (Greater Than): This operator checks if the value on the left side is greater than the value on the right side. For example: 5 > 3 is true, because 5 is greater than 3.

< (Less Than): This operator checks if the value on the left side is less than the value on the right side. For example: 5 < 3 is false, because 5 is not less than 3.

>= (Greater Than or Equal To): This operator checks if the value on the left side is greater than or equal to the value on the right side. For example: 5 >= 5 is true, because 5 is equal to 5.

<= (Less Than or Equal To): This operator checks if the value on the left side is less than or equal to the value on the right side. For example: 5 <= 3 is false, because 5 is not less than 3.

== (Equal To): This operator checks if the values on both sides are equal, performing type coercion if necessary. For example: '5' == 5 is true, because JavaScript coerces the string to a number before comparing.

|= (Bitwise OR Assignment): This is a compound assignment operator. It performs a bitwise OR operation between the values on both sides and assigns the result to the left side. For example: a |= b is equivalent to a = a | b.

=== (Strict Equal To): This operator checks if the values on both sides are equal and of the same type. For example: '5' === 5 is false, because they are of different types.

|== (Invalid Operator): This doesn't have a valid meaning in JavaScript. It's not a recognized operator.
